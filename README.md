# Wine Quality Prediction

This project focuses on predicting the quality of wine based on various physicochemical features using machine learning techniques. It was developed to demonstrate supervised learning and model evaluation for regression tasks.

---

## üìå Overview

The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that estimates wine quality based on characteristics such as acidity, sugar content, pH, and more.

Key steps in this project include:
- Data preprocessing and analysis
- Feature selection
- Model training and evaluation (Linear Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine)
- Predicting quality scores and comparing model performance
- Saving the trained model using `joblib` for future reuse

## üìä Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas**
- **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **Joblib** (for model saving/loading)
- **Jupyter Notebook**

## üöÄ How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repo or download the `.ipynb` notebook
2. Install required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn joblib

## The dataset used is the Wine Quality Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains physicochemical properties of red or white wine samples along with quality scores given by testers.
